Abstract
Cloud computing promises flexibility and high performance
for users and high cost-efficiency for operators. Nevertheless, most cloud facilities operate at very low utilization,
hurting both cost effectiveness and future scalability.
We present Quasar, a cluster management system that
increases resource utilization while providing consistently
high application performance. Quasar employs three techniques. First, it does not rely on resource reservations,
which lead to underutilization as users do not necessarily
understand workload dynamics and physical resource requirements of complex codebases. Instead, users express
performance constraints for each workload, letting Quasar
determine the right amount of resources to meet these constraints at any point. Second, Quasar uses classification techniques to quickly and accurately determine the impact of
the amount of resources (scale-out and scale-up), type of
resources, and interference on performance for each workload and dataset. Third, it uses the classification results to
jointly perform resource allocation and assignment, quickly
exploring the large space of options for an efficient way
to pack workloads on available resources. Quasar monitors
workload performance and adjusts resource allocation and
assignment when needed. We evaluate Quasar over a wide
range of workload scenarios, including combinations of distributed analytics frameworks and low-latency, stateful services, both on a local cluster and a cluster of dedicated EC2
servers. At steady state, Quasar improves resource utilization by 47% in the 200-server EC2 cluster, while meeting
performance constraints for workloads of all types.

Introduction

An increasing amount of computing is now hosted on public clouds, such as Amazon’s EC2 [2], Windows Azure [65]
and Google Compute Engine [25], or on private clouds managed by frameworks such as VMware vCloud [61], OpenStack [48], and Mesos [32]. Cloud platforms provide two
major advantages for end-users and cloud operators: flexibility and cost efficiency [9, 10, 31]. Users can quickly launch
jobs that range from short, single-process applications to
large, multi-tier services, only paying for the resources used
at each point. Cloud operators can achieve economies of
scale by building large-scale datacenters (DCs) and by sharing their resources between multiple users and workloads.
Nevertheless, most cloud facilities operate at very low
utilization which greatly adheres cost effectiveness [9, 51].
This is the case even for cloud facilities that use cluster
management frameworks that enable cluster sharing across
workloads. In Figure 1, we present a utilization analysis for
a production cluster at Twitter with thousands of servers,
managed by Mesos [32] over one month. The cluster mostly
hosts user-facing services. The aggregate CPU utilization
is consistently below 20%, even though reservations reach
up to 80% of total capacity (Fig. 1.a). Even when looking
at individual servers, their majority does not exceed 50%
utilization on any week (Fig. 1.c). Typical memory use is
higher (40-50%) but still differs from the reserved capacity. Figure 1.d shows that very few workloads reserve the
right amount of resources (compute resources shown here,
similar for memory); most workloads (70%) overestimate
reservations by up to 10x, while many (20%) underestimate
reservations by up to 5x. Similarly, Reiss et al. showed that a
12,000-server Google cluster managed with the more mature
Borg system consistently achieves aggregate CPU utilization
of 25-35% and aggregate memory utilization of 40% [51]. In
contrast, reserved resources exceed 75% and 60% of available capacity for CPU and memory respectively.
Twitter and Google are in the high end of the utilization
spectrum. Utilization estimates are even lower for cloud facilities that do not co-locate workloads the way Google and

Twitter do with Borg and Mesos respectively. Various analyses estimate industry-wide utilization between 6% [15] and
12% [24, 59]. A recent study estimated server utilization on
Amazon EC2 in the 3% to 17% range [38]. Overall, low utilization is a major challenge for cloud facilities. Underutilized servers contribute to capital expenses and, since they
are not energy proportional [36, 42], to operational expenses
as well. Even if a company can afford the cost, low utilization is still a scaling limitation. With many cloud DCs consuming 10s of megawatts, it is difficult to add more servers
without running into the limits of what the nearby electricity
facility can deliver.
In this work, we increase resource utilization in datacenters through better cluster management. The manager
is responsible for providing resources to various workloads
in a manner that achieves their performance goals, while
maximizing the utilization of available resources. The manager must make two major decisions; first allocate the right
amount of resources for each workload (resource allocation)
and then select the specific servers that will satisfy a given allocation (resource assignment). While there has been significant progress in cluster management frameworks [21, 32, 54,
63], there are still major challenges that limit their effectiveness in concurrently meeting application performance and
resource utilization goals. First, it is particularly difficult to
determine the resources needed for each workload. The load
of user-facing services varies widely within a day, while the
load of analytics tasks depends on their complexity and their
dataset size. Most existing cluster managers side-step allocation altogether, requiring users or workloads to express
their requirements in the form of a reservation. Nevertheless, the workload developer does not necessarily understand
the physical resource requirements of complex codebases or
the variations in load and dataset size. As shown in Figure 1.d, only a small fraction of the workloads submitted
to the Twitter cluster provided a right-sized reservation. Undersized reservations lead to poor application performance,
while oversized reservations lead to low resource utilization.

Equally important, resource allocation and resource assignment are fundamentally linked. The first reason is heterogeneity of resources, which is quite high as servers get
installed and replaced over the typical 15-year lifetime of
a DC [9, 20]. A workload may be able to achieve its current performance goals with ten high-end or twenty lowend servers. Similarly, a workload may be able to use lowend CPUs if the memory allocation is high or vice versa.
The second reason is interference between co-located workloads that can lead to severe performance losses [41, 69].
This is particularly problematic for user-facing services that
must meet strict, tail-latency requirements (e.g., low 99th
percentile latency) under a wide range of traffic scenarios
ranging from low load to unexpected spikes [16]. Naı̈vely
co-locating these services with low-priority, batch tasks that
consume any idling resources can lead to unacceptable latencies, even at low load [41]. This is the reason why cloud
operators deploy low-latency services on dedicated servers
that operate at low utilization most of the time. In facilities that share resources between workloads, users often exaggerate resource reservations to side-step performance unpredictability due to interference. Finally, most cloud facilities are large and involve thousands of servers and workloads, putting tight constraints on the complexity and time
that can be spent making decisions [54]. As new, unknown
workloads are submitted, old workloads get updated, new
datasets arise, and new server configurations are installed, it
is impractical for the cluster manager to analyze all possible
combinations of resource allocations and assignments.
We present Quasar, a cluster manager that maximizes
resource utilization while meeting performance and QoS
constraints for each workload. Quasar includes three key
features. First, it shifts from a reservation-centric to a
performance-centric approach for cluster management. Instead of users expressing low-level resource requests to the
manager, Quasar allows users to communicate the performance constraints of the application in terms of throughput and/or latency, depending on the application type. This
high-level specification allows Quasar to determine the least

amount of the available resources needed to meet performance constraints at any point, given the current state of
the cluster in terms of available servers and active workloads. The allocation varies over time to adjust to changes in
the workload or system state. The performance-centric approach simplifies both the user and cloud manager’s roles
as it removes the need for exaggerated reservations, allows transparent handling of unknown, evolving, or irregular workloads, and provides additional flexibility towards
cost-efficient allocation.
Second, Quasar uses fast classification techniques to determine the impact of different resource allocations and assignments on workload performance. By combining a small
amount of profiling information from the workload itself
with the large amount of data from previously-scheduled
workloads, Quasar can quickly and accurately generate the
information needed for efficient resource assignment and allocation without the need for a priori analysis of the application and its dataset. Specifically, Quasar performs four parallel classifications on each application to evaluate the four
main aspects of resource allocation and assignment: the impact of scale-up (amount of resources per server), the impact
of scale-out (number of servers per workload), the impact of
server configuration, and the impact of interference (which
workloads can be co-located).
Third, Quasar performs resource allocation and assignment jointly. The classification results are used to determine
the right amount and specific set of resources assigned to
the workload. Hence, Quasar avoids overprovisioning workloads that are currently at low load and can compensate
for increased interference or the unavailability of high-end
servers by assigning fewer or lower-quality resources to
them. Moreover, Quasar monitors performance throughout
the workload’s execution. If performance deviates from the
expressed constraints, Quasar reclassifies the workload and
adjusts the allocation and/or assignment decisions to meet
the performance constraints or minimize the resources used.
We have implemented and evaluated a prototype for
Quasar managing a local 40-server cluster and a 200-node
cluster of dedicated EC2 servers. We use a wide range of
workloads including analytics frameworks (Hadoop, Storm,
Spark), latency-critical and stateful services (memcached,
Cassandra), and batch workloads. We compare Quasar to
reservation-based resource allocation coupled with resource
assignment based on load or similar classification techniques. Quasar improves server utilization at steady state
by 47% on average at high load in the 200-server cluster,
while also improving performance of individual workloads
compared to the alternative schemes. We show that Quasar
can right-size the allocation of analytics and latency-critical
workloads better than built-in schedulers of frameworks like
Hadoop, or auto-scaling systems. It can also select assignments that take heterogeneity and interference into account
so that throughput and latency constraints are closely met.

Motivation

2.1

Cluster Management Overview

A cluster management framework provides various services
including security, fault tolerance, and monitoring. This paper focuses on the two tasks most relevant to resource efficiency: resource allocation and resource assignment of incoming workloads. Previous work has mostly treated the two
separately.
Resource allocation: Allocation refers to determining the
amount of resources used by a workload: number of servers,
number of cores and amount of memory and bandwidth resources per server. Managers like Mesos [32], Torque [58],
and Omega [54] expect workloads to make resource reservations. Mesos processes these requests and, based on availability and fairness issues [27], makes resource offers to individual frameworks (e.g., Hadoop) that the framework can
accept or reject. Dejavu identifies a few workload classes
and reuses previous resource allocations for each class
to minimize reallocation overheads [60]. CloudScale [56],
PRESS [29], AGILE [46] and the work by Gmach et al. [28]
perform online prediction of resource needs, often without
a priori workload knowledge. Finally, auto-scaling systems
such as Rightscale [52] automatically scale the number of
physical or virtual instances used by webserving workloads
to react to observed changes in server load.
Resource assignment: Assignment refers to selecting the
specific resources that satisfy an allocation. The two biggest
challenges of assignment are server heterogeneity and interference between colocated workloads [41, 44, 69], when
servers are shared to improve utilization. The most closely
related work to this paper is Paragon [20]. Given a resource
allocation for an unknown, incoming workload, Paragon
uses classification techniques to quickly estimate the impact
of heterogeneity and interference on performance. Paragon
uses this information to assign each workload to server
type(s) that provide the best performance and colocate workloads that do not interfere with each other. Nathuji et al. [45]
developed a feedback-based scheme that tunes resource assignment to mitigate interference effects. Yang et al. developed an online scheme that detects memory pressure and
finds colocations that avoid interference on latency-sensitive
workloads [69]. Similarly, DeepDive detects and manages
interference between co-scheduled applications in a VM
system [47]. Finally, CPI2 [73] throttles low-priority workloads that induce interference to important services. In terms
of managing heterogeneity, Nathuji et al. [44] and Mars et
al. [40] quantified its impact on conventional benchmarks
and Google services and designed schemes to predict the
most appropriate server type for each workload.

The Case for Coordinated Cluster Management

Despite the progress in cluster management technology, resource utilization is quite low in most private and public
clouds (see Figure 1 and [15, 24, 38, 51, 59]). There are two

major shortcomings current cluster managers have. First, it
is particularly difficult for a user or workload to understand
its resource needs and express them as a reservation. Second, resource allocation and assignment are fundamentally
linked. An efficient allocation depends on the amount and
type of resources available and the behavior of other workloads running on the cluster.
Figure 2 illustrates these issues by analyzing the impact of various allocations, assignments, and workload aspects on two representative applications, one batch and one
latency-critical: a large Hadoop job running a recommendation algorithm on the Netflix dataset [11] and a memcached service under a read-intensive load. For Hadoop, we
report speedup over a single node of server configuration
A using all available cores and memory. Server configurations, interference settings and datasets are summarized
in Table 1. The variability in each violin plot is due to
the different amounts of resources (cores and memory) allocated within each server. For memcached, we report the
latency-throughput graphs. Real-world memcached deploy-

ments limit throughput to achieve 99th-percentile latencies
between 0.2ms and 1ms.
The first row of Figure 2 illustrates the behavior of
Hadoop. The heterogeneity graph shows that the choice of
server configuration introduces performance variability of
up to 7x, while the amount of resources allocated within each
server introduces variability of up to 10x. The interference
graph shows that for server A, depending on the amount of
resources used, Hadoop may be insensitive to certain types
of interference or slowdown by up to 10x. Similarly, the
scale-out graph shows that depending on the amount of resources per server, scaling may be sublinear or superlinear.
Finally, the dataset graph shows that the dataset complexity
and size can have 3x impact on Hadoop’s performance. Note
that in addition to high variability, the violin plots show that
the probability distributions change significantly across different allocations. The results are similar for memcached, as
shown in the second row of Figure 2. The position of the
knee of the throughput-latency curve depends heavily on the
type of server used (3x variability), the interference patterns

(7x variability), the amount of resources used per server (8x
variability), and workload characteristics such as data size
and read/write mixes (3x variability).
It is clear from Figure 2 that it is quite difficult for a user
or workload to translate a performance goal to a resource
reservation. To right-size an allocation, we need to understand how scale-out, scale-up, heterogeneity in the currently
available servers, and interference from the currently running jobs affect a workload with a specific dataset. Hence,
separating resource allocation and assignment through reservations is bound to be suboptimal, either in terms of resource
efficiency or in terms of workload performance (see Figure 1). Similarly, performing first allocation and then assignment in two separate steps is also suboptimal. Cluster management must handle both tasks in an integrated manner.

3.

Quasar

3.1

Overview

Quasar differs from previous work in three ways. First,
it shifts away from resource reservations and adopts a
performance-centric approach. Quasar exports a high-level
interface that allows users or the schedulers integrated in
some frameworks (e.g., Hadoop or Spark) to express the performance constraint the workload should meet. The interface
differentiates across workload types. For latency-critical
workloads, constraints are expressed as a queries per second
(QPS) target and a latency QoS constraint. For distributed
frameworks like Hadoop, the constraint is execution time.
For single node, single-threaded or multi-threaded workloads the constraint is a low-level metric of instructions-persecond (IPS). Once performance constraints are specified, it
is up to Quasar to find a resource allocation and assignment
that satisfies them.
Second, Quasar uses fast classification techniques to
quickly and accurately estimate the impact different resource
allocation and resource assignment decisions have on workload performance. Upon admission, an incoming workload
and dataset is profiled on a few servers for a short period of
time (a few seconds up to a few minutes - see Sec. 3.2). This
limited profiling information is combined with information
from the few workloads characterized offline and the many
workloads that have been previously scheduled in the system using classification techniques. The result of classification is accurate estimates of application performance as we
vary the type or number of servers, the amount of resources
within a server, and the interference from other workloads.
In other words, we estimate graphs similar to those shown in
Figure 2. This classification-based approach eliminates the
need for exhaustive online characterization and allows efficient scheduling of unknown or evolving workloads, or
new datasets. Even with classification, exhaustively estimating performance for all allocation-assignment combinations would be infeasible. Instead, Quasar decomposes
the problem to the four main components of allocation and

assignment: resources per node and number of nodes for
allocation, and server type and degree of interference for assignment. This dramatically reduces the complexity of the
classification problem.
Third, Quasar uses the result of classification to jointly
perform resource allocation and assignment, eliminating
the inherent inefficiencies of performing allocation without knowing the assignment challenges. A greedy algorithm
combines the result of the four independent classifications
to select the number and specific set of resources that will
meet (or get as close as possible to) the performance constraints. Quasar also monitors workload performance. If the
constraint is not met at some point or resources are idling,
either the workload changed (load or phase change), classification was incorrect, or the greedy scheme led to suboptimal results. In any case, Quasar adjusts the allocation and
assignment if possible, or reclassifies and reschedules the
workload from scratch.
Quasar uses similar classification techniques as those introduced in Paragon [20]. Paragon handles only resource assignment. Hence, its classification step can only characterize
workloads with respect to heterogeneity (server type) and
interference. In contrast, Quasar handles both resource allocation and assignment. Hence, its classification step also
characterizes scale-out and scale-up issues for each workload. Moreover, the space of allocations and assignments
that Quasar must explore is significantly larger than the
space of assignments explored by Paragon. Finally, Quasar
introduces an interface for performance constraints in order
to decouple user goals from resource allocation and assignment. In Section 6, we compare Quasar to Paragon coupled
with current resource allocation approaches to showcase the
advantages of Quasar.
3.2

Fast and Accurate Classification

Collaborative filtering techniques are often used in recommendation systems with extremely sparse inputs [50]. One
of their most publicized use was the Netflix Challenge [11],
where techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) and PQ-reconstruction [13, 35, 50, 66] were used to
provide movie recommendations to users that had only rated
a few movies themselves, by exploiting the large number of
ratings from other users. The input to SVD in this case is a
very sparse matrix A with users as rows, movies as columns
and ratings as elements. SVD decomposes A to the product of the matrix of singular values Σ that represents similarity concepts in A, the matrix of left singular vectors U
that represents correlation between rows of A and similarity concepts, and the matrix of right singular vectors V that
represents the correlation between columns of A and similarity concepts (A = U · Σ·V T ). A similarity concept can be
that users that liked “Lord of the Rings 1” also liked “Lord
of the Rings 2”. PQ-reconstruction with Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD), a simple latent-factor model [13, 66], uses
Σ, U , and V to reconstruct the missing entries in A. Starting

with the SVD output, P T is initialized to ΣV T and Q to U
which provides an initial reconstruction of A. Subsequently,
SGD iterates over all elements of the reconstructed matrix
R=Q·P T until convergence.
For each element rui of R:
ui = rui − µ − bu − qi · pu T
qi ← qi + η(ui pu − λqi )
pu ← q
pu + η(ui qi − λpu )
P
2
until ||L2 =
u,i |ui | becomes marginal. η is the learning rate and λ the regularization factor of SGD and their values are determined empirically. In the above model, we also
include the average rating µ and a user bias bu that account
for the divergence of specific users from the norm. Once the
matrix is reconstructed, SVD is applied once again to generate movie recommendations by quantifying the correlation
between new and existing users. The complexity of SVD
is O(min(N 2 M, M 2 N )), where M , N the dimensions of
A, and the complexity of PQ-reconstruction with SGD is
O(N · M ).
In Paragon [20], collaborative filtering was used to quickly
classify workloads with respect to interference and heterogeneity. A few applications are profiled exhaustively offline
to derive their performance on different servers and with
varying amounts of interference. An incoming application is
profiled for one minute on two of the many server configurations, with and without interference in two shared resources.
SVD and PQ-reconstruction are used to accurately estimate
the performance of the workload on the remaining server
configurations and with interference on the remaining types
of resources. Paragon showed that collaborative filtering can
quickly and accurately classify unknown applications with
respect to tens of server configurations and tens of sources
of interference.
The classification engine in Quasar extends the one in
Paragon in two ways. First, it uses collaborative filtering
to estimate the impact of resource scale-out (more servers)
and scale-up (more resources per server) on application performance. These additional classifications are necessary for
resource allocation. Second, it tailors classifications to different workload types. This is necessary because different
types for workloads have different constraints and allocation knobs. For instance, in a webserver we can apply both
scale-out and scale-up and we must monitor queries per second (QPS) and latency. For Hadoop, we can also configure
workload parameters such as the number of mappers per
node, heapsize, and compression. For a single-node workload, scaling up might be the only option while the metric
of interest can be instructions per second. The performance
constraints interface of Quasar allows users to specify the
type of submitted applications.
Overall, Quasar classifies for scale-up, scale-out, heterogeneity, and interference. The four classifications are done
independently and in parallel to reduce complexity and overheads. The greedy scheduler combines information from all

four. Because of the decomposition of the problem the matrix dimensions decrease, and classification becomes fast
enough that it can be applied on every workload submission, even if the same workload is submitted multiple times
with different datasets. Hence there is no need to classify for
dataset sensitivity.
Scale-up classification: This classification explores how
performance varies with the amount of resources used within
a server. We currently focus on compute cores, memory and
storage capacity. We will address network bandwidth in future work. We perform scale-up classification on the highestend platform, which offers the largest number of scale-up
options. When a workload is submitted, we profile it briefly
with two randomly-selected scale-up allocations. The parameters and duration of profiling depend on workload type.
Latency-critical services, like memcached are profiled for 510 seconds under live traffic, with two different core/thread
counts and memory allocations (see the validation section
for a sensitivity analysis on the number of profiling runs).
For workloads like Hadoop, we profile a small subset (2-6)
of map tasks with two different allocations and configurations of the most important framework parameters (e.g.,
mappers per node, JVM heapsize, block size, memory per
task, replication factor, and compression). Profiling lasts until the map tasks reach at least 20% of completion, which
is typically sufficient to estimate the job’s completion time
using its progress rate [70] and assuming uniform task duration [32]. Section 4.3 addresses the issue of non-uniform
task duration distribution and stragglers. Finally, for stateful
services like Cassandra [14], Quasar waits until the service’s
setup is complete before profiling the input load with the
different allocations. This takes at most 3-5 minutes, which
is tolerable for long-running services. Section 4.2 discusses
how Quasar guarantees side-effect free application copies
for profiling runs.
Profiling collects performance measurements in the format of each application’s performance goal (e.g., expected
completion time or QPS) and inserts them into a matrix
A with workloads as rows and scale-up configurations as
columns. A configuration includes compute, memory, and
storage allocations or the values of the framework parameters for a workload like Hadoop. To constrain the number of columns, we quantize the vectors to integer multiples of cores and blocks of memory and storage. This may
result into somewhat suboptimal decisions, but the deviations are small in practice. Classification using SVD and
PQ-reconstruction then derive the workload’s performance
across all scale-up allocations.
Scale-out classification: This type of classification is only
applicable to workloads that can use multiple servers, such
as distributed frameworks (e.g., Hadoop or Spark), stateless
(e.g., webserving) or stateful (e.g., memcached or Cassandra) distributed services, and distributed computations (e.g.,
MPI jobs). Scale-out classification requires one more run in

decision overheads for different density constraints of the input matrices, assuming constant hardware resources for profiling.
addition to single-node runs done for scale-up classification.
To get consistent results, profiling is done with the same parameters as one of the scale-up runs (e.g., JVM heapsize)
and the same application load. This produces two entries
for matrix A, where rows are again workloads and columns
are scale-out allocations (numbers of servers). Collaborative
filtering then recovers the missing entries of performance
across all node counts. Scale-out classification requires additional servers for profiling. To avoid increasing the classification overheads when the system is online, applications
are only profiled on one to four nodes for scale-out classification. To accurately estimate the performance of incoming workloads for larger node counts, in offline mode, we
have exhaustively profiled a small number of different workload types (20-30) against node counts 1 to 100. These runs
provide the classification engine with dense information on
workload behavior for larger node counts. This step does not
need to repeat unless there are major changes in the cluster’s
hardware or application structure.
Heterogeneity classification: This classification requires
one more profiling run on a different and randomly-chosen
server type using the same workload parameters and for the
same duration as a scale-up run. Collaborative filtering estimates workload performance across all other server types.
Interference classification: This classification quantifies
the sensitivity of the workload to interference caused and tolerated in various shared resources, including the CPU, cache
hierarchy, memory capacity and bandwidth, and storage and
network bandwidth. This classification does not require an
extra profiling run. Instead, it leverages the first copy of

the scale-up classification to inject, one at a time, two microbenchmarks that create contention in a specific shared resource [19]. Once the microbenchmark is injected, Quasar
tunes up its intensity until the workload performance drops
below an acceptable level of QoS (typically 5%). This point
is recorded as the workload’s sensitivity to this type of interference in a new row in the corresponding matrix A. The
columns of the matrix are the different sources of interference. Classification is then applied to derive the sensitivities
to the remaining sources of interference. Once the profiling runs are complete the different types of classification reconstruct the missing entries and provide recommendations
on efficient allocations and assignments for each workload.
Classification typically takes a few msec even for thousands
of applications and servers.
Multiple parallel versus single exhaustive classification:
Classification is decomposed to the four components previously described for both accuracy and efficiency reasons.
The alternative design would consist of a single classification that examines all combinations of resource allocations
and resource assignments at the same time. Each row in
this case is an incoming workload, and each column is an
allocation-assignment vector. Exhaustive classification addresses pathological cases that the four simpler classifications estimate poorly. For example, if TCP incast occurs for
a specific allocation, only on a specific server platform that
is not used for profiling, its performance impact will not be
identified by classification. Although these cases are rare,
they can result in unexpected performance results. On the
other hand, the exponential increase in the column count in

the exhaustive scheme increases the time required to perform classification [35, 50, 66] (note that this occurs at every application arrival). Moreover, because the number of
columns now exceeds the number of rows, classification accuracy decreases, as SVD finds fewer similarities with high
confidence [26, 49, 64].
To address this issue without resorting to exhaustive classification, we introduce a simple feedback loop that updates
the matrix entries when the performance measured at runtime deviates from the one estimated through classification.
This loop addresses such misclassifications, and additionally
assists with scaling to server counts that exceed the capabilities of profiling, i.e., more than 100 nodes.
Validation: Table 2 summarizes a validation of the accuracy of the classification engine in Quasar. We use a 40server cluster and applications from Hadoop (10 data-mining
jobs), latency-critical services (10 memcached jobs, and 10
Apache webserver loads), and 413 single-node benchmarks
from SPEC, PARSEC, SPLASH-2, BioParallel, Minebench
and SpecJbb. The memcached and webserving jobs differ in
their query distribution, input dataset and/or incoming load.
Hadoop jobs additionally differ in terms of the application
logic. Details on the applications and systems can be found
in Section 5. We show average, 90th percentile and maximum errors for each application and classification type. The
errors show the deviation between estimated and measured
performance or sensitivity to interference. On average, classification errors are less than 8% across all application types,
while maximum errors are less than 17%, guaranteeing that
the information that drives cluster management decisions is
accurate. Table 2 also shows the corresponding errors for
the exhaustive classification. In this case, average errors are
slightly higher, especially for applications arriving early in
the system [49], however, the deviation between average and
maximum errors is now lower, as the exhaustive classification can accurately predict performance for the pathological
cases that the four parallel classifications miss.
We also validate the selected number of profiling runs,
i.e., how classification accuracy changes with the density of
the input matrices. Figure 3(a-d) shows how the 90th percentile of errors from classification changes as the density
of the corresponding input matrix increases. For clarity, we
omit the plots for Webserver, which has similar patterns to
memcached. For all four classification types, a single profiling run per classification results in high errors. Two or more
entries per input row result in decreased errors, although the
benefits reach the point of diminishing returns after 4-5 entries. This behavior is consistent across application types,
although the exact values of errors may differ. Unless otherwise specified, we use 2 entries per row in subsequent experiments. Figure 3e shows the overheads (profiling and classification) for the three application classes (Hadoop, memcached, single node) as input matrix density increases. We
assume that the hardware resources used towards profiling

and classification are kept constant. Obviously as the number of profiling runs increases the overheads increase significantly, without equally important accuracy improvements.
The figure also shows the overheads from classification only
(excluding profiling) for the four parallel classifications (4p)
and the exhaustive scheme (exh.). As expected, the increase
in column count corresponds in an increase in decision time,
often by two orders of magnitude.
3.3

Greedy Allocation and Assignment

The classification output is given to a greedy scheduler that
jointly determines the amount, type, and exact set of allocated resources. The scheduler’s objective is to allocate the
least amount of resources needed to satisfy a workload’s performance target. This greatly reduces the space the scheduler
traverses, allowing it to examine higher quality resources
first, as smaller quantities of them will meet the performance
constraint. This approach also scales well to many servers.
The scheduler uses the classification output, to first rank
the available servers by decreasing resource quality, i.e., high
performing platforms with minimal interference first. Next,
it sizes the allocation based on available resources until the
performance constraint is met. For example, if a webserver
must meet a throughput of 100K QPS with 10msec 99th percentile latency and the highest-ranked servers can achieve
at most 20K QPS, the workload would need five servers to
meet the constraints. If the number of highest-ranked servers
available is not sufficient, the scheduler will also allocate
lower-ranked servers and increase their number. The feedback between allocation and assignment ensures that the
amount and quality of resources are accounted for jointly.
When sizing the allocation, the algorithm first increases the
per-node resources (scale-up) to better pack work in few
servers, and then distributes the load across machines (scaleout). Nevertheless, alternative heuristics can be used based
on the workload’s locality properties or to address fault tolerance concerns.
The greedy algorithm has O(M · logM + S) complexity, where the first component accounts for the sorting overhead and the second for the examination of the top S servers,
and in practice takes a few msec to determine an allocation/assignment even for systems with thousands of servers.
Despite its greedy nature, we show in Section 6 that the decision quality is quite high, leading to both high workload performance and high resource utilization. This is primarily due
to the accuracy of the information available after classification. A potential source of inefficiency is that the scheduler
allocates resources on a per-application basis in the order
workloads arrive. Suboptimal assignments can be detected
by sampling a few workloads (e.g., based on job priorities if
they are available) and adjusting their assignment later on as
resources become available when other workloads terminate.
Finally, the scheduler employs admission control to prevent
oversubscription when no resources are available.

Figure 4: The steps for cluster management with Quasar.
Starting from the top, short runs using sandboxed workload copies produce the initial profiling signal that classification techniques expand to information about relationship
between performance and scale-up, scale-out, heterogeneity,
and interference. Finally, the greedy scheduler uses the classification output to find the number and type of resources
that maximize utilization and application performance.

filing only requires a few seconds to complete. Once the
profiling results are available, classification provides the full
workload characterization (speedup graph). Next, the greedy
scheduler assigns specific servers to the workload. Overall,
Quasar’s overheads are quite low even for short-running applications (batch, analytics) or long running online services.
Quasar maintains per-workload and per-server state. Perworkload state includes the classification output. For a cluster with 10 server types and 10 sources of interference, we
need roughly 256 bytes per workload. The per-server state
includes information on scheduled applications and their cumulative resource interference, roughly 128B in total. The
per-server state is updated on each workload assignment.
Quasar also needs some storage for the intermediate classification results and for server ranking during assignment.
Overall, state overheads are marginal and scale linearly with
the number of workloads and servers. In our experiments,
a single server was sufficient to handle the total state and
computation of cluster management. Additional servers can
be used for fault-tolerance.

Implementation

We implemented a prototype for Quasar in about 6KLOC of
C, C++, and Python. It runs on Linux and OS X and currently
supports applications written in C/C++, Java, and Python.
The API includes functions to express the performance constraints and type of submitted workloads, and functions to
check job status, revoke it, or update the constraints. We
have used Quasar to manage analytics frameworks such as
Hadoop, Storm, and Spark, latency-critical services such
as NoSQL workloads, and conventional single-node workloads. There was no need to change any applications or
frameworks. The framework-specific code in Quasar is 100600 LOC per framework. In the future, we plan to merge the
Quasar classification and scheduling algorithms in a cluster
management framework like OpenStack or Mesos.

Putting it All Together

Figure 4 shows the different steps of cluster management in
Quasar. Upon arrival of a workload, Quasar collects profiling data for scale-out and scale-up allocations, heterogeneity, and interference. This requires up to four profiling runs
that happen in parallel. All profiling copies are sandboxed
(as explained in Section 4.2), the two platforms used are A
and B (two nodes of A are used for the scale-out classification) and each profiling type produces two points in the
corresponding speedup graph of the workload. The profiling
runs happen with the actual dataset of the workload. The total profiling overhead depends on the workload type and is
less than 5 min in all cases we examined. For non-stateful
services, e.g., small batch workloads that are a large fraction of DC workloads [54], the complete profiling takes 1015 seconds. Note that for stateful services, e.g., Cassandra,
where setup is necessary, it only affects one of the profiling runs. Once the service is warmed-up, subsequent pro-

4.1

Dynamic Adaptation

Some workloads change behavior during their runtime, either due to phase changes or due to variation in user traffic.
Quasar detects such changes and adjusts resource allocation
and/or assignment to preserve the performance constraints.
Phase detection: Quasar continuously monitors the performance of all active workloads in the cluster. If a workload runs below its performance constraint, it either went
through a phase change or was incorrectly classified or assigned. In any case, Quasar reclassifies the application at its
current state and adjusts its resources as needed (see discussion below). We also proactively test for phase changes and
misclassifications/misscheduling by periodically sampling a
few active workloads and injecting interfering microbenchmarks to them. This enables partial interference classification in place. If there is a significant change compared to the
original classification results, Quasar signals a phase change.

Proactive detection is particularly useful for long-running
workloads that may affect co-located workloads when entering a phase change. We have validated the phase detection
schemes with workloads from SPECCPU2006, PARSEC,
Hadoop and memcached. With the reactive-only scheme,
Quasar detects 94% of phase changes. By sampling 20%
of active workloads every 10 minutes, we detect 78% of
changes proactively with 8% probability of false positives.
Allocation adjustment: Once the phase has been detected
or load increases significantly for a user-facing workload,
Quasar changes the allocation to provide more resources or
reclaim unused resources. Quasar adjusts allocations in a
conservative manner. It first scales up or down the resources
given to the workload in each of the servers it currently occupies. If needed, best-effort (low priority) workloads are
evicted from these servers. If possible, a scale-up adjustment
is the simplest option as it typically requires no state migration. If scale-up is not possible or cannot address the performance needs, scale-out and/or migration to other servers
is used. For stateless services (e.g., adding/removing workers to Hadoop or scaling a webserver), scale-out is straightforward. For stateful workloads, migration and scale-out
can be expensive. If the application is organized in microshards [16], Quasar will migrate a fraction of the load
from each server to add capacity at minimum overhead. At
the moment, Quasar does not employ load prediction for
user-facing services [29, 46]. In future work, we will use
such predictors as an additional signal to trigger adjustments
for user-facing workloads.
4.2

Side Effect Free Profiling

To acquire the profiling data needed for classification, we
must launch multiple copies of the incoming application.
This may cause inconsistencies with intermediate results,
duplicate entries in databases, or data corruption on file systems. To eliminate such issues, Quasar uses sandboxing for
the training copies during profiling. We use Linux containers [8] with chroot to sandbox profiling runs and create
a copy-on-write filesystem snapshot so that files (including
framework libraries) can be read and written as usual [72].
Containers enable full control over how training runs interact
with the rest of the system, including limiting resource usage through cgroups. Using virtual machines (VMs) for the
same purpose is also possible [47, 62, 63, 68], but we chose
containers as they incur lower overheads for launching.
4.3

Stragglers

In frameworks like Hadoop or Spark, individual tasks may
take much longer to complete for reasons that range from
poor work partitioning to network interference and machine
instability [4]. These straggling tasks are typically identified and relaunched by the framework to ensure timely job
completion [1, 3, 4, 17, 23, 37, 70]. We improve straggler
detection in Hadoop in the following manner. Quasar calls
the TaskTracker API in Hadoop and checks for under-

performing tasks (at least 50% slower than the median). For
such tasks, Quasar injects two contentious microbenchmarks
in the corresponding servers and reclassifies them with respect to interference caused and tolerated. If the results of the
in-place classification differ from the original by more than
20%, we signal the task as a straggler and notify the Hadoop
JobTracker to relaunch it on a newly assigned server. This
allows Quasar to detect stragglers 19% earlier than Hadoop,
and 8% earlier than LATE [70] for the Hadoop applications
described in the first scenario in Section 5.
4.4

Discussion

Cost target: Apart from a performance target, a user could
also specify a cost constraint, priorities, and utility functions
for a workload [55]. These can either serve as a limit for
resource allocation or to prioritize allocations during very
high load. We will consider these issues in future work.
Resource partitioning: Quasar does not explicitly partition hardware resources. Instead, it reduces interference by
co-locating workloads that do not contend on the shared resources. Resource partitioning is orthogonal. If mechanisms
like cache partitioning or rate limiting at the NIC are used,
interference can be reduced and more workload colocations
will be possible using Quasar. In that case, Quasar will have
to determine the settings for partitioning mechanisms, in the
same way it determines the number of cores to use for each
workload. We will consider these issues in future work.
Fault tolerance: We use master-slave mirroring to provide
fault-tolerance for the server that runs the Quasar scheduler.
All system state (list of active applications, allocations, QoS
guarantees) is continuously replicated and can be used by
hot-standby masters. Quasar can also leverage frameworks
like ZooKeeper [5] for more scalable schemes with multiple
active schedulers. Quasar does not explicitly add to the fault
tolerance of frameworks like MapReduce. In the event of a
failure, the cluster manager relies on the individual frameworks to recover missing worker data. Our current resource
assignment does not account for fault zones. However, this
is a straight forward extension for the greedy algorithm.

5.

Methodology

Clusters: We evaluated Quasar on a 40-server local cluster
and a 200-server cluster on EC2. The ten platforms of the local cluster range from dual core Atom boards to dual socket
24 core Xeon servers with 48GB of RAM. The EC2 cluster
has 14 server types ranging from small to x-large instances.
All servers are dedicated and managed only by Quasar, i.e.,
there is no interference from external workloads.
The following paragraphs summarize the workload scenarios used to evaluate Quasar. Scenarios include batch and
latency-critical workloads and progressively evaluate different aspects of allocation and assignment. Unless otherwise
specified experiments are run 7 times for consistency and
we report the average and standard deviation.

Single Batch Job: Analytics frameworks like Hadoop [30],
Storm [57], and Spark [71] are large consumers of resources
on private and public clouds. Such frameworks have individual schedulers that set the various framework parameters (e.g., mappers per node and block size) and determine
resource allocation (number of servers used). The allocations made by each scheduler are suboptimal for two reasons. First, the scheduler does not have full understanding
of the complexity of the submitted job and dataset. Second,
the scheduler is not aware of the details of available servers
(e.g., heterogeneity), resulting in undersized or overprovisioned allocations. In this first scenario, a single Hadoop job
is running at a time on the small cluster. This simple scenario allows us to compare the resource allocation selected
by Hadoop to the allocation/assignment of Quasar on a single job basis. We use ten Hadoop jobs from the Mahout
library [39] that represent data mining and machine learning analyses. The input datasets vary between 1 and 900GB.
Note that there is no workload co-location in this scenario.
Multiple Batch Jobs: The second scenario represents a
realistic setup for batch processing clusters. The cluster is
shared between jobs from multiple analytics frameworks
(Hadoop, Storm, and Spark). We use 16 Hadoop applications
running on top of the Mahout library, four workloads for
real-time text and image processing in Storm, and four workloads for logical regression, text processing and machine
learning in Spark. These jobs arrive in the cluster with 5
sec inter-arrival times. Apart from the analytics jobs, a number of single-server jobs are submitted to the cluster. We use
workloads from SPECCPU2006, PARSEC [12], SPLASH2 [67], BioParallel [34], Minebench [43] and 350 multiprogrammed 4-app mixes from SPEC [53]. These single-server
workloads arrive with 1 second inter-arrival times and are
treated as best-effort (low priority) load that fills any cluster
capacity unused by analytics jobs. There are not guarantees
on performance of best-effort tasks, which may be migrated
or killed at any point to provide resources for analytics tasks.
We compare Quasar to allocations done by the frameworks themselves (Hadoop, Spark, Storm schedulers) and
assignments by a least-loaded scheduler that accounts for
core and memory use but not heterogeneity or interference.

Low-Latency Service: Latency-critical services are also
major tenants in cloud facilities. We constructed a webserving scenario using the HotCRP conference management system [33], which includes the Apache webserver, application
logic in PHP, and data stored in MySQL. The front- and
back-end run on the same machine, and the installation is
replicated across several machines. The database is kept purposefully small (5GB) so that it is cached in memory and
emphasis is placed on compute, cache, memory and networking issues, and not on disk performance. HotCRP traffic
includes requests to fill in paper abstracts, update author information, and upload or read papers. Apart from throughput
constraints, HotCRP requires a 100msec per-request latency.
We use three traffic scenarios: flat, fluctuating, and large
spike. Apart from satisfying HotCRP constraints, we want
to use any remaining cluster capacity for single-node, besteffort tasks (see description in previous scenario). We compare Quasar to a system that uses an auto-scaling approach to
scale HotCRP between 1 and 8 servers based on the observed
load of the servers used [6]. Auto-scale allocates an additional, least-loaded server for HotCRP when current load exceeds 70% [7] and redirects a fair share of the traffic to the
new server instance. Load balancing happens on the workload generator side. Best-effort jobs are assigned by a leastloaded (LL) scheduler. Quasar deals with load changes in
HotCRP by either scaling-up existing allocations or scalingout (more servers) based on how the two affect performance.
Stateful Latency-Critical Services: This scenario extends
the one above in two ways. First, there are multiple lowlatency services. Second, these services involve significant
volumes of state. Specifically, we examine the deployment

of memory-based memcached [22] and disk-based Cassandra [14], two latency-critical NoSQL services. Memcached
(1TB state) is presented with load that fluctuates following
a diurnal pattern with maximum aggregate throughput target
of 2.4M QPS and a 200usec latency constraint. The diskbound Cassandra (4TB state) has a lower load of 60K QPS of
maximum aggregate throughput and a 30 msec latency constraint. Any cluster capacity unused by the two services is
utilized for best-effort workloads which are submitted with
10sec inter-arrival times. To show the fluctuation of utilization with load, and since scaling now involves state migration, this scenario runs over 24 hours and is repeated 3 times
for consistency. Similarly to the previous scenario, we compare Quasar with the auto-scaling approach and measure performance (throughput and latency) for the two services and
overall resource utilization. Scale-out in this case involves
migrating one (64MB) or more microshards to a new instance, which typically takes a few msec.
Large-Scale Cloud Provider: Finally, we bring everything
together in a general case where 1200 workloads of all types
(analytics batch, latency-critical, and single-server jobs) are
submitted in random order to a 200-node cluster of dedicated
EC2 servers with 1 sec inter-arrival time. All applications
have the same priority and no workload is considered besteffort (i.e., all paying customers have equal importance).
The scenario is designed to use almost all system cores at
steady-state, without causing oversubscription, under ideal
resource allocation. We do, however, employ admission control to prevent machine oversubscription, when allocation is
imperfect [18]. Wait time due to admission control counts
towards scheduling overheads. Quasar handles allocation
and assignment for all workloads. For comparison, we use
an auto-scale approach for resource allocation of latencycritical workloads. For frameworks like Hadoop and Storm,
the framework estimates its resource needs and we treat that
as a reservation. For resource assignment, we use two schedulers: a least-loaded scheduler that simply accounts for core
and memory availability and Paragon that, given a resource
allocation, can do heterogeneity- and interference-aware assignment. The latter allows us to demonstrate the benefits of
jointly solving allocation and assignment over separate (although optimized) treatment of the two.

Evaluation

6.1

Single Batch Job

Performance: Fig. 5 shows the reduction in execution time
of ten Hadoop jobs when resources are allocated by Quasar
instead of Hadoop itself. We account for all overheads, including classification and scheduling. Quasar improves performance for all jobs by an average of 29% and up to 58%.
This is significant given that these Hadoop jobs take two to
twenty hours to complete. The yellow dots show the execution time improvement needed to meet the performance target the job specified at submission. Targets are set to the best
performance achieved after a parameter sweep on the different server platforms. Quasar achieves performance within
5.8% of the constraint on average, leveraging the information of how resource allocation and assignment impact performance. When resources are allocated by Hadoop, performance deviates from the target by 23% on average.
Efficiency: Table 3 shows the different parameter settings
selected by Quasar and by Hadoop for the H8 Hadoop job,
a recommendation system that uses Mahout with a 20GB
dataset [39]. Apart from the block size and replication factor,
the two frameworks set job parameters differently. Quasar
detects that interference between mappers is low and increases the mappers per node to 12. Similarly, it detects that
heap size is not critical for this job and reduces its size, freeing resources for other workloads. Moreover, Quasar allocates tasks to the two most suitable server types (E and F),
while Hadoop chooses from all available server types.
6.2

Multiple Batch Frameworks

Performance: Fig. 6 shows the reduction in execution times
for Hadoop, Storm, and Spark jobs when Quasar manages
resource allocation and assignment. On average, performance improves by 27% and comes within 5.3% of the provided constraint, a significant improvement over the baseline. Apart from sizing and configuring jobs better, Quasar
can aggressively co-locate them. For example, it can detect
when two memory-intensive Storm and Spark jobs interfere and when they can efficiently share a system. Quasar
allows the remaining cluster capacity to be used for besteffort jobs without disturbing the primary jobs because it is
interference-aware. Best-effort jobs come within 7.8% on

average of the peak performance each job could achieve if it
was running alone on the highest performing server type.
Utilization: Fig. 7 shows the per-server CPU utilization (average across all cores) over time in the form of a heatmap.
Utilization is sampled every 5 sec. In addition to improving individual job performance, Quasar increases utilization,
achieving 62% on average versus 34% with the individual framework schedulers (right heatmap). Because performance is now higher the whole experiment completes faster.
Workloads after t = 14400 are mostly best-effort jobs that
take longer than the main analytics workloads to complete.
6.3

Low-Latency Service

Performance: Fig. 8a shows the aggregate throughput for
HotCRP achieved with Quasar and the auto-scaling system
when the input traffic is flat. While the absolute differences
are small, it is important to note that the auto-scaling manager causes frequent QPS drops due to interference from
best-effort workloads using idling resources. With Quasar,
HotCRP runs undisturbed and the best-effort jobs achieve
runtimes within 5% of minimum, while with auto-scale,
they achieve runtimes within 24% of minimum. When traffic
varies (Fig. 8b), Quasar tracks target QPS closely, while au-

toscale provides 18% lower QPS on average, both due to interference and suboptimal scale-up configuration. Quasar’s
smooth behavior is due to the use of both scale-out and scaleup to best meet the new QPS target, leaving the highest number of cores possible for best-effort jobs (Fig. 8c). For the
load with the sharp spike, Quasar tracks QPS within 4% on
average (Fig. 8d) and meets the latency QoS for nearly all requests (Fig. 8e). When the spike arrives, Quasar first scales
up each existing allocation, and then only uses two extra
servers of suitable type to handle remaining traffic. The autoscaling system observes the load increase when the spike
arrives and allocates four more servers. Due to the higher latency of scale-out and the fact that auto-scaling is not aware
of heterogeneity or interference, it fails to meet the latency
guarantees for over 20% of requests around the spike arrival.
6.4

Stateful Latency-Critical Services

Performance: Fig. 9 shows the throughput of memcached
and Cassandra over time and the distribution of query latencies. Quasar tracks throughput targets closely for both
services, while the auto-scaling manager degrades throughput by 24% and 12% on average for memcached and Cassandra respectively. The differences in latency are larger
between the two managers. Quasar meets latency QoS for
memcached for 98.8% of requests, while auto-scaling only
for 80% of requests. For Cassandra, Quasar meets the latency QoS for 98.6% of requests, while the auto-scaling for
93% of requests. Memcached is memory-based and has an
aggressive latency QoS, making it more sensitive to suboptimal resource allocation and assignment on a shared cluster.
Utilization: Fig. 10 shows the utilization of CPU, memory
capacity, and disk bandwidth across the cluster servers when
managed by Quasar over 24h. Each column is a snapshot
of average utilization over 6 hours. Since memcached and
Cassandra have low CPU requirements, excluding the period
18:00-24:00 when Cassandra performs garbage collection,
most of the CPU capacity is allocated to best-effort jobs. The
number of best-effort jobs varies over time because the exact
load of memcached and Cassandra changes. Most memory
is used to satisfy the requirements of memcached, with small
amounts needed for Cassandra and best-effort jobs. Cassandra is the nearly exclusive user of disk I/O. Some servers do
not exceed 40-50% utilization for most of the experiment’s

duration. These are low-end machines, for which higher utilization dramatically increases the probability of violating
QoS constraints for latency-critical services. In general, the
cluster utilization is significantly higher than if each service
was running in dedicated machines.
6.5 Large-Scale Cloud Provider
Performance: Figure 11 presents the overall evaluation of
Quasar managing a 200-node cluster running all previouslydiscussed types of workloads. We compare to resource allocation based on reservations (e.g., expressed by the Hadoop
scheduler or an auto-scaling system) and resource assignment on least-loaded machines (LL) or based on the interference and heterogeneity-aware Paragon. Figure 11a shows
the performance of the 1,200 workloads ordered from worstto best-performing, normalized to their performance target.
Quasar achieves 98% of the target on average, while the
reservation-based system with Paragon achieves 83%. This
shows the need to perform allocation and assignment together; the intelligent resource assignment by Paragon is not
sufficient. Using reservations and LL assignment performs
quite poorly, only achieving 62% of the target on average.
Utilization: Figures 11b-c show the per-server CPU utilization throughout the scenario’s execution for Quasar and
the reservation+LL system. Average utilization is 62% with
Quasar, while meeting performance constraints for both
batch and latency-critical workloads. The reservation+LL
manager achieves average utilization of 15%, 47% lower
than Quasar. Figure 11d shows the allocated and used resources for Quasar compared to the resources reserved by
the reservation+LL manager over time. Overprovisioning
with Quasar is low, with the difference between allocated
and used being roughly 10%. This is significantly lower
than the resources reserved by the reservation-based manager, which exceed the capacity of the cluster during most
of the scenario. Because Quasar has detailed information on
how different allocations/assignments affect performance, it
can rightsize the allocations more aggressively, while meeting the performance constraints without QoS violations.
Cluster management overheads: For most applications
the overheads of Quasar from profiling, classification, greedy
selection and adaptation are low, 4.1% of execution time on

average. For short-lived batch workloads, overheads are up
to 9%. The overheads are negligible for any long-running
service, and even for jobs lasting a few seconds, they only
induce single-digit increases in execution time. In contrast
with reservation+LL, Quasar does not introduce any wait
time overheads due to oversubscription.

Conclusions

We have presented Quasar, a cluster management system
that performs coordinated resource allocation and assignment. Quasar moves away from the reservation-based standard for cluster management. Instead of users requesting raw
resources, they specify a performance target the application
should meet and let the manager size resource allocations
appropriately. Quasar leverages robust classification techniques to quickly analyze the impact of resource allocation
(scale-up and scale-out), resource type (heterogeneity), and
interference on performance. A greedy algorithm uses this
information to allocate the least amount of resources necessary to meet performance constraints. Quasar currently supports distributed analytics frameworks, web-serving applications, NoSQL datastores, and single-node batch workloads.
We evaluated Quasar over a variety of workload scenarios
and compared it to reservation/auto-scaling-based resource
allocation systems and schedulers that use similar classification techniques for resource assignment (but not resource allocation). We showed that Quasar improves aggregate cluster utilization and individual application performance.
